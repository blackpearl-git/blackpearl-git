- 👋 Hi, my name is Alan and I run Pittflix.com, a site I use to share & showcase my work. My github...handle? is @blackpearl-git. 

- 👀 I’m interested in self-hosted projects of all kinds. The dream is to make self-hosted projects accessible to the general public in a way that restores the control of an person's 'data' to that person...a self-hosted future. 🌱 I’m currently learning how to implement a self-hosted home assistant AI/LLM, rather than rely on Jeff Bezos. 

- 💞️ I'm currently looking for work as a Red Hat Certified Server Administrator with 8 years of hands-on Linux experience. If you need a Server Admin, reach out! 
- 📫 How to reach me ... alan@pittflix.com, or on the Pittflix discord channel. If you got here from me resume, firstly, thank you for reading, and my personal email is listed there.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The human body is a biome that supports over 10,000 different species of other organisms. We've been self-hosting for a long time.
