- 👋 Hi, my name is Alan and I run Pittflix.com, a site I use to share projects with family & friends. My github...handle? is @blackpearl-git. "Blackpearl" is the admittedly uncreative device name I gave to the NAS I built in 2022, which hosts the site. I've also assembled an RGB matrix using a Raspberry Pi & the Adafruit controller board, including designing the casing based on templates available online.

- 👀 I’m interested in self-hosted projects of all kinds. The dream is to make self-hosted projects accessible to the general public in a way that restores the control of an person's 'data' to that person. 🌱 I’m currently learning how to take control of my smarthome ecosystem. I want to implement a self-hosted home assistant AI/LLM that works on open-source hardware I can assemble myself, rather than rely on Jeff Bezos. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything. I'd like to learn how to use other display types, such as e-ink displays for low-power solutions or touchscreens for interactive hub & controller devices.
- 📫 How to reach me ... alan@pittflix.com, or on the Pittflix discord channel.

- ⚡ Fun fact: The human body is a biome that supports over 10,000 different species of other organisms. We've been self-hosting for a long time.
